-->  When representating a Float data type, We should append letter f to the end of the data type otherwise it will save as double.
     ex: float=5.67f
     if we do not write f and we declare float=5.67 then it will return error because java automatically considered 5.67 as a double value.
 
--> In java if you do not assign value to variable then if a variable is instance variable(which you declare in the class) then it by default holds 0.
    same as static variable also holds 0 if you haven't assigned him but local variable(defined inside the function) they holds noting and stay as blank 
    so if you try to access them then it will return an error.
    
--> instance variable, static variable holds value 0 if they are not assigned value and refrence variable holds null if they are not assigned.
    
--> You can not declare varibale as static inside a method. 
    Inside method all variables are local variables that has no existance outside this method thats why they cann't be static.
    
--> There can on;y be one public class in java file. you need to save file name same as the class name which has the main method.
